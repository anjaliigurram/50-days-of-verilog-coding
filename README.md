Verilog-Coding Repository
Welcome to the Verilog-Coding Repository! This repository contains Verilog code for various behavioral modeling circuits. It serves as a comprehensive collection of Verilog code snippets that cover a wide range of behavioral modeling concepts and exercises. Each code snippet represents a specific concept or exercise worked on during the 50 days of practice.
If you are using EDA Playground to run and simulate the Verilog code, you might find an extra line in the testbench code:
initial begin 
    $dumpfile("dump.vcd"); 
    $dumpvars;
end
You can remove this section if you are not using EDA Playground for your simulations.
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to add more examples, improve existing code, or update documentation. Please fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request with your changes.
Enjoy coding and learning Verilog!
